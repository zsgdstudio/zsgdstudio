# 1 Introduction

## How to play tabletop RPG

RPGs are player by group of four to seven (recommended) or two to whatever (possible) people.

Participants engage in collective storytelling about their characters (roleplay aspect)
using set of game rules (game aspect).

One of participants takes the role of game master who is portal between others and the game world.
The rest of participants take the role of player who has narrative control each over their own character.

Game loop is:
- Master (GM) describes the situation player characters (PCs) find themselves in.
- Players describes actions of their characters.
- Using their understanding of the world and game rules GM decides outcome of situation and describes it.
- Return to step 1 and repeat.

## Fairydust

Fairydust is a tabletop RPG system (set of rules).
Each system has its features and created for specific type of stories.

Fairydust just like real fairy dust is:
- Magical. Game rules heavily focus on magic system.
  Stories played with Fairydust should happend in magical world and PCs should by magic users. 
- Lightweight. Game rules are relatively easy and short.
  Describing character with game characteristics takes less time that coming up with the character in the first place.
- Colorful. Game rules are not tied to definite setting, your story may happen when- and wherever you please.
  (Mind the fact, there should be magic in the world.)
- Disperse. Fairydust is easy to change, unused mechanics are easy to drop, new one - to include.

Fairydust is good at telling stories where:
- Spotlight is on the group of heroes.
- The group includes different character with strong personalities.
- Characters has different abilities and creatively use them.
- Plot includes mystery and action.

Examples of such stories are _Avatar: The Last Airbender_; _W.I.T.C.H.;_ _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_.

## d-notation

Most tabletop RPGs use d-notation.
`d` means a dice roll.
Number after `d` determines number of faces of the dice.
Number before `d` determines number of the dices to roll.

>`d6` - 6 sided die.
>`3d6` - 3 of 6 sided dies.

After that additional number may be specified to add/subtract from result of the roll.

>`d12 - 3` - 12 sided die minus 3.

Exclamation mark `!` before `d` denotes _exploding die_.
When such die roll results in maximum (die _explodes_) additional roll is made and its result is added to previous one.
This additional roll may explode as well potentially yielding infinitely big numbers.

>Primary die roll used in Fairydust is `!d10`. 

Finally symbols `v` and `^` mean _maximum_ or _minimum_ respectively.

>`v2d8` - minimum of 2 rolls of 8 sided die.
>`^3!d10` - maximum of 3 exploding rolls of 10 sided die.
